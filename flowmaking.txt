see first i implement the greedy immediate pairing , but it have some problems 

Issue 1: Perfect Pairing Problem
The algorithm tries to pair every available user immediately
This creates a scenario where everyone is either:
Coupled (in active chat)
Alone in queue (waiting)
When users are perfectly paired, there are no free users for skipped users to match with
Issue 2: Skip Functionality Breakdown ⏭️
When a user skips their partner:
Both users get disconnected
Both need to find new partners
But if everyone else is already paired → no one available
Result: Users stuck in queue indefinitely




//now i decided to move to pool based matching to solve this issue.
